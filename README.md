# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior data from an e-commerce platform to identify distinct customer segments. By understanding these segments, businesses can better target marketing campaigns, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize their overall marketing strategy.

## Project Description
Customer segmentation is a powerful marketing technique that involves dividing a customer base into distinct segments based on shared characteristics, behaviors, or demographics. The primary purpose is to better understand and serve customers in a more personalized and targeted way.

The analysis includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering
- Cluster Analysis and Interpretation
- Marketing Recommendations

## Dataset
The project uses customer data that includes:
- Demographics (age, income, family status, education)
- Purchase behavior (spending on different product categories)
- Campaign responses
- Website activity
- Shopping channels (web, catalog, store purchases)

## Files
- `customer_segmentation_analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook with synthetic data generation and analysis
- `marketing-analytics-customer-segmentation.ipynb`: Alternative notebook with more detailed marketing analytics approach using imported data

## Features
The analysis examines various customer attributes, including:
- Income
- Age
- Family composition (children, teenagers)
- Purchase recency
- Spending patterns across product categories
- Response to campaigns
- Preferred purchase channels
- Website engagement
- Education level
- Marital status

## Requirements
To run the notebooks, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- scipy

## Usage
1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure all required libraries are installed
3. Open and run either notebook in a Jupyter environment

## Results
The segmentation analysis identifies distinct customer groups with different purchasing behaviors and preferences. These insights can help businesses:
- Personalize marketing campaigns
- Optimize product offerings
- Improve customer retention strategies
- Maximize return on marketing investments

## Future Work
- Implement more advanced clustering techniques
- Integrate customer lifetime value predictions
- Develop recommendation systems based on segment preferences
- Create a dashboard for interactive segment exploration
